## 🔬 Methodology

### Data Collection

**Source:** Reddit API via PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper)

**Collection Strategy:**
- Keyword-based filtering: "anime", "japanese animation", specific anime titles
- Target communities: Mix of dedicated (r/anime) and mainstream (r/movies) subreddits
- Time period: All-time historical data (2007-2025)
- Collection date: August-October 2025

**Filtering Criteria:**
Posts mentioning anime-related terms including:
- Generic: "anime", "manga", "japanese animation"
- Popular titles: "Your Name", "Demon Slayer", "Attack on Titan", "One Piece", "Studio Ghibli"
- Creators: "Makoto Shinkai", "Hayao Miyazaki"

### Sentiment Analysis Pipeline

**Three-Model Ensemble Approach:**

#### 1. VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)
- **Type:** Rule-based lexicon
- **Strength:** Optimized for social media text, handles slang and emoji
- **Library:** `vaderSentiment 3.3.2`
- **Output:** Compound score normalized to [-1, 1]

#### 2. TextBlob
- **Type:** Pattern-based NLP
- **Strength:** Good polarity detection, sensitive to negative patterns
- **Library:** `textblob 0.17.1`
- **Output:** Polarity score [-1, 1]

#### 3. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
- **Type:** Deep learning transformer model
- **Strength:** Context-aware, handles nuanced language
- **Model:** `distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english`
- **Library:** `transformers 4.30+`
- **Output:** Sentiment probability converted to [-1, 1]

**Ensemble Calculation:**
```python
ensemble_score = (vader_score + textblob_score + bert_score) / 3
```

**Classification Thresholds:**
- **Positive:** ensemble_score > 0.05
- **Neutral:** -0.05 ≤ ensemble_score ≤ 0.05
- **Negative:** ensemble_score < -0.05

### Quality Assurance

- ✅ Zero duplicate submissions (verified by unique Reddit IDs)
- ✅ Complete temporal coverage (no date gaps)
- ✅ All critical fields populated (title, text, timestamp)
- ✅ Manual validation of 500 random samples
- ✅ Cross-validation of sentiment models on 100 hand-labeled posts

## 🛠️ Usage Examples

### Quick Start with Python
```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load main dataset
df = pd.read_csv('sentiment_analysis_results.csv')

# Basic exploration
print(f"Total submissions: {len(df):,}")
print(f"Average sentiment: {df['ensemble_score'].mean():.3f}")
print(f"Positive rate: {(df['sentiment_label'] == 'Positive').mean():.1%}")

# Sentiment by subreddit
subreddit_sentiment = df.groupby('subreddit')['ensemble_score'].mean().sort_values(ascending=False)
print("\nTop 5 Most Positive Communities:")
print(subreddit_sentiment.head())

# Temporal analysis
df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['created_utc'], unit='s')
df['year'] = df['date'].dt.year

yearly_sentiment = df.groupby('year')['ensemble_score'].agg(['mean', 'count'])
yearly_sentiment.plot(kind='line', y='mean', figsize=(12, 6))
plt.title('Anime Sentiment Evolution (2007-2025)')
plt.ylabel('Average Sentiment Score')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.grid(True, alpha=0.3)
plt.show()
```

### Quick Start with R
```r
library(tidyverse)

# Load dataset
df <- read_csv('sentiment_analysis_results.csv')

# Summary statistics
df %>%
  group_by(subreddit) %>%
  summarise(
    avg_sentiment = mean(ensemble_score),
    positive_pct = mean(sentiment_label == "Positive"),
    count = n()
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_sentiment))

# Temporal visualization
df %>%
  mutate(
    date = as_datetime(created_utc),
    year = year(date)
  ) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(sentiment = mean(ensemble_score)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = sentiment)) +
  geom_line(color = "steelblue", size = 1.2) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", color = "darkred") +
  labs(
    title = "Anime Sentiment Evolution on Reddit",
    subtitle = "2007-2025 (18 years)",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Average Sentiment Score"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

### Load Yearly Trends
```python
# Load pre-aggregated yearly data
yearly = pd.read_csv('yearly_sentiment.csv')

print(yearly[['year', 'mean', 'yoy_change', 'yoy_pct_change']])

turning_points = yearly[yearly['yoy_change'].abs() > 0.07]
print("\nMajor Turning Points:")
print(turning_points[['year', 'mean', 'yoy_change']])
```

### Analyze Release Impact
```python
# Load release impact data
releases = pd.read_csv('release_impact.csv')

print(releases.sort_values('sentiment_change', ascending=False))

releases.plot(
    x='title', 
    y='sentiment_change', 
    kind='barh',
    figsize=(10, 6),
    color=['green' if x > 0 else 'red' for x in releases['sentiment_change']]
)

## ⚠️ Data Ethics & Limitations

### Ethical Considerations
- ✅ All data is publicly available on Reddit
- ✅ Usernames included but can be anonymized if needed
- ✅ No private or sensitive information collected
- ✅ Compliant with Reddit's API Terms of Service

### Known Limitations

**1. Platform Bias**
- Reddit represents Western, English-speaking, tech-savvy demographic
- May not reflect broader population sentiment
- Skews toward younger, male audiences

**2. Sample Bias**
- Keyword filtering may miss relevant discussions
- Focus on 10 subreddits may exclude important communities
- Self-selection bias in who posts about anime

**3. Temporal Gaps**
- Reddit archive availability varies by year
- Early years (2007-2010) have fewer submissions
- Some historical data may be incomplete

**4. Model Limitations**
- Sentiment models may struggle with sarcasm, irony, cultural context
- Ensemble approach mitigates but doesn't eliminate errors
- Manual validation shows ~85-90% accuracy

**5. Language Constraints**
- English-only discussions
- Misses non-English anime discourse
- Cultural nuances may be lost in translation

### Recommended Best Practices
- Use alongside other data sources for comprehensive analysis
- Consider temporal and community context when interpreting results
- Validate findings with qualitative analysis where possible
- Be cautious about causal claims (correlation ≠ causation)
